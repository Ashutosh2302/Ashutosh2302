<!-- <h4 align="center">Ever since I was a kid, I'd always wondered how things work on the internet which made me eager to learn something about how the internet works and that's when I learned to create web pages for the first time. Gradually, learned full-stack Web Development practicing various courses on the online platform.</h4>

<!-- <h4 align="center">This passion carried me to my education in the field of Computer Engineering at Trinity College Dublin and Thapar Institute. And it was here when I learned how much there was yet to learn. Which later drove me towards Artificial Intelligence. So, I've started learning Deep Learning and Computer Vision aswell.</h4>
